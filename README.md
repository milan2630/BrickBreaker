This project implements the game of Breakout.

Name: Milan Bhat (mb554)

### Timeline

Start Date: 1/13/20

Finish Date: 1/20/20

Hours Spent: 25

### Resources Used
Google/Stack Overflow/Geeks4Geeks to look up syntax and different ways to do desired actions.

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: LevelFiles folder which includes setup for levels 1-4.

Key/Mouse inputs: move paddle left and right with left and right arrow keys. Start by hitting space to fire the ball. 

Cheat keys: 1-4 skips to the level of the number. 5 makes the ball return to the paddle and centers both. 6 adds a life. Clicking y wins the game.

Known Bugs: With a lot of bricks, the program runs incredibly slowly and does not work on levels 3 and 4 because it is checking too many things at once. This occurs because I am constantly checking every object in the screen to see if it is in contact with any others.

Extra credit: I made a pause screen that explains the cheat codes and allows you to restart the game.


### Notes/Assumptions
I assumed that the level files are all in the same format and that they do not contain any empty lines. The normal bricks also remain the same color regardless of how many hits they take to break.

### Impressions
Very interesting and fun first project to get in the game-design mindset. Having more time 
and more guidance about requirements would be helpful.
