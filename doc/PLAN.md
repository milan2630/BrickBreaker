# Game Plan
## Milan Bhat (mb554)


### Breakout Variant

I thought that the Vortex variant of the Breakout game was the most interesting.
The game being circular rather than up and down was a unique twist 
that made it seem like the user has the ability to do more actions
than simply moving side to side. The ball bouncing into a tunnel
also made the game appear 3D which was a visually pleasing feature. 


### General Level Descriptions

The first level will be a single line of bricks so that the player can 
become accustomed to the controls of the game. The future levels will be as
follows, with 1s representing moving blocks and 2s representing powerup blocks.



### Bricks Ideas

I would like to create a variety of bricks to make the game more interesting.
Firstly, I would create both horizontally-moving and stationary bricks. I would also make bricks
that require different numbers of hits to break, ranging from 1 to 20 hits.
Some bricks will also contain power-ups to help the player. 

### Power Up Ideas

My game would include the basic powerups of multiple balls, heavier balls which count as 2 hits,
and a paddle enlarger. The paddle enlarger would only last for a specific amount of time.
I would also add a power-up that slows down the ball for a set amount of time,
and one that speeds up the paddle. Additionally, there would be negative powerups
that would increase the ball speed, shrink the paddle, or make the paddle move more slowly.


### Cheat Key Ideas

In order to be able to quickly skip levels, I would include cheat keys 
in my game. Holding a certain combination of keys together, potentially the 
"B" and "H" keys, would destroy all the bricks in the level automatically.

### Something Extra

To extend on the game, I will include a score counter and a pause screen.
The pause screen is a significant addition because it will allow players
to take a break from the game while playing. If something makes the player
not be able to focus on the game anymore, they can simply click "P" to
pause the game.
